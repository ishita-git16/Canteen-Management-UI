## Features 
1) 4 card components were picked to display the four canteen counters respectively, and the total count was displayed on a wide strip just below the counters.
2) The current time counter and type of scheduled meal was displayed in the header so that users could see it straightaway at one glance.
3) The choice of background colour of the app was in accordance with the company’s logo so as to maintain the brand identity.
